# **App Name**: AgriAssist AI

## Core Features:

- Crop Recommendation: Recommend optimal crops based on soil data, weather forecasts, crop rotation history, and market prices, using a generative AI tool to interpret these data sources holistically.
- Multilingual Support: Provide a multilingual user interface to allow farmers to enter data and receive recommendations in their local language.
- Offline Access: Enable offline functionality, ensuring farmers in low-connectivity regions can still access core features.
- Recommendation Explainer: Summarize key factors influencing the crop recommendation (e.g., weather patterns, market trends).
- Visualized Predictions: Display interactive charts and graphs to show predicted yield, profit margins, and sustainability scores for each recommended crop.
- Constraint-based Crop Filtering: Allow the user to specify constraints such as sustainability, yield, or profit, and see only the crops that meet the specified criteria.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, earthy green (#73A371) to represent growth and nature. The concept is intended to evoke a feeling of natural processes, rather than commerce.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated green (#F0F4F0), subtly different from pure white to reduce starkness.
- Accent color: A warm yellow (#E4B24F) to highlight actionable items, and provide contrast on the darker green background. This color should appear to be from a hue somewhat "left" of the primary, at about 30 degrees difference.
- Font pairing: Use 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Literata' (serif) for body text.
- Use clean, vector-based icons representing crops, weather elements, and soil properties.
- Employ a card-based layout to display crop recommendations and related information in a structured format.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to provide feedback during data processing and crop recommendation generation.
